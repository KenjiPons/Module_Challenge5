# Module_Challenge5

# NOTE: The last commit of this git will have happened after the submission deadline and might therefore
# be penalized for being a late submission. I've sent an email to my program advisor because, unfortunately,
# I had a family emergency last night that required me to unexpectedly leave the class and, now, submit an incomplete assignment
# after the deadline has passed, with two skipped modules already in my record. I apologize in advance for the sloppy work you're
# about to review. I was expecting to have a couple of hours after the class to finish the last section and clean up the code.

# I used Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT to help me debug (since they can instantly explain each section of the code as you
# feed it to them. In addition, I went back to previous modules to cannibalize and review past exercises. I tried to annotate where I used
# XPERT assistant and ChatGPT. I relied on them throughout the plotting section in order to differentiate between what was PANDAS and pyplot.
